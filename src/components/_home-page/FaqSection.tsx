            and I&apos;m from Chicago, IL, but I reside and teach the 5th grade
            in Seoul, South Korea. I&apos;m making {APP_NAME} because I have
            scoured the Internet (and perhaps my Google-fu has failed me) to
            find these tools. Alas, I have found nothing like these on the
            Internet, so I&apos;m making them! Yes, there are other sites that
            do have some of the{" "}

          <AccordionContent>
            {APP_NAME} is currently free for authorized users because we are in
            alpha. Alpha means that not all of the core features are
            implemented. At some point, we will have a public beta. Sign up to

            I am honestly not sure about this. There is only one person who is
            making this, though, so that means {APP_NAME}&apos;s overhead is
            very low, and I hope to keep it that way. My goal is to be able to
            offer it for 3 USD per month if you sign up for a year, else 5 USD
            per month, but I&apos;m not promising anything.
